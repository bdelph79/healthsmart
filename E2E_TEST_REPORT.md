2. ‚úÖ **Runner reuse** - Single Runner instance created at startup, reused for all requests
3. ‚úÖ **Session management** - EnhancedSessionManager working correctly
4. ‚úÖ **Tool-based architecture** - All services using function tools (not agent transfers)
5. ‚úÖ **ToolContext state** - RPM/Insurance eligibility tools using ToolContext.state
6. ‚úÖ **Model stability** - gemini-2.5-flash performing reliably

**Removed Anti-Patterns:**
- ‚ùå HealthcareAssistant wrapper class (deleted 240+ lines)
- ‚ùå Per-request Runner creation (now single global Runner)
- ‚ùå Experimental model (switched to stable gemini-2.5-flash)

## Bug Fixes Verified

### 1. ‚úÖ Confidence Type Conversion Bug (FIXED)

**Previous Issue:** `ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'High'`

**Root Cause:** LLM passing confidence as string ("High") instead of numeric value

**Fix Applied:** [app/smart_health_agent.py:637-656](app/smart_health_agent.py#L637-656)
```python
# Handle string confidence levels (LLM sometimes returns "High", "Medium", "Low")
if isinstance(raw_confidence, str):
    confidence_mapping = {
        'high': 0.9,
        'medium': 0.7,
        'low': 0.5,
        'very high': 0.95,
        'very low': 0.3
    }
    confidence = confidence_mapping.get(raw_confidence.lower(), 0.7)
else:
    try:
        confidence = float(raw_confidence)
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        confidence = 0.7  # Default if conversion fails
```

**Verification:** All 7 test cases completed without TypeError ‚úÖ

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Medicare Recognition Bug (FIXED)

**Previous Issue:** Agent asking about insurance twice after user said "Medicare"

**Root Cause:** `extract_insurance_info()` returning `True/False`, but merge logic skipping `False` values

**Fix Applied:** [app/smart_health_agent.py:926](app/smart_health_agent.py#L926)
```python
# OLD: if value is not None and value is not False:
# NEW: if value is not None:  # Allow False for explicit "no"
```

**Verification:** Use Case 1 (RPM) correctly acknowledged Medicare without duplicate questions ‚úÖ
