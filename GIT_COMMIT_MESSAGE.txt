feat: Enhancement 1 - Transparent service engagement (remove routing confusion)

## Changes Made

### 1. Renamed Function (Lines 281-388)
- `route_to_specialist()` → `engage_service_focus()`
- Added optional `eligibility_result` parameter for confidence scoring
- Removed all "routing to specialist" language
- Added service-specific benefits messaging (5 services)
- Added confidence-based qualification messaging (3 levels)
- Emphasized single assistant model with focused service help

### 2. Updated Coordinator Agent Instructions (Lines 582-694)
- Complete rewrite emphasizing single-agent model
- Added "Your Identity" section clarifying ONE assistant
- Removed all "hand off" and "routing" terminology
- Added explicit DON'T list forbidding routing language
- Updated workflow to use `engage_service_focus()`
- Added communication guidelines (DO/DON'T sections)

### 3. Updated Tool Registration (Line 686)
- Changed from `route_to_specialist` to `engage_service_focus`

## Impact
