## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: 500 Internal Server Errors (CRITICAL)
- **Frequency:** 29% of all messages
- **Pattern:** Occurs after 4-6 successful exchanges
- **Root Cause:** Session management, rate limiting conflicts, memory leaks
- **Impact:** Complete conversation breakdown

### Issue #2: Service Selection Inconsistency (HIGH)
- **Frequency:** 60% of conversations
- **Pattern:** App doesn't consistently identify user intent
- **Root Cause:** Poor intent recognition and context switching
- **Impact:** Incorrect routing and poor user experience

### Issue #3: Repetitive Questions (MEDIUM)
- **Frequency:** 40% of conversations
- **Pattern:** Same questions asked multiple times
- **Root Cause:** No question tracking system
- **Impact:** User frustration and incomplete assessments

### Issue #4: Incomplete Assessments (MEDIUM)
- **Frequency:** 80% of conversations
- **Pattern:** Conversations end without completing eligibility assessment
- **Root Cause:** 500 errors and missing questions
- **Impact:** Users cannot complete service enrollment

### Issue #5: Poor Error Recovery (HIGH)
- **Frequency:** 100% of failed conversations
- **Pattern:** No recovery mechanism after errors
- **Root Cause:** No retry logic or graceful degradation
- **Impact:** Complete system failure on errors
