## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Strengths (Keep Doing)
- Question options now listed (chronic conditions, insurance)
- No repetitive questions detected
- Follow-up contact messaging implemented
- Apology reduction working well

### üîß Areas for Improvement

#### High Priority
1. **Enhance Off-Topic Handling**
   - Make redirects warmer and more personalized
   - Include specific health options in redirect

2. **Response Conciseness**
   - Continue monitoring response length
   - Ensure 2-3 sentence guideline is followed

3. **Emotional Warmth** (Needs Playwright testing)
   - Add more informal language recognition
   - Include micro-acknowledgments
   - Validate feelings more explicitly

#### Medium Priority
1. **Tone Refinement**
   - Ensure human-first language throughout
   - Avoid any remaining cold/clinical phrasing

2. **Bullet Point Usage**
   - Monitor for excessive bullets
   - Use only when truly beneficial

#### Low Priority
1. Visual presentation (requires UI testing)
2. Advanced conversation flows
3. Edge case handling

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. ‚úÖ Review resolved issues - verify in production
2. üîß Address partially resolved issues
3. üìù Plan fixes for not-resolved issues

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Install Playwright: `pip install playwright && playwright install`
2. Run comprehensive Playwright test suite
3. Test emotional warmth indicators
4. Validate all 30 feedback items

### Long-term (Next Month)
1. Continuous monitoring with automated tests
2. A/B testing of conversational styles
3. User acceptance testing with real patients
4. Tone analysis ML model integration
