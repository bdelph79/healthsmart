	Feedback on the Test Chatbot  
1	The bot often feels robotic and transactional ("I apologize..the system is still prompting for your age") rather than supportive 
2	The repetition and rigidity (age confirmation loops) make the experience feel dismissive, not empowering 
3	Too much detail is given at once (lists, long explanations, mini-essays). Users should see one simple action per turn 
4	Bot talks about "system issues" instead of keeping focus on the person's needs. This breaks the human-first feel 
5	Responses are too long - walls of text make it feel like a lecture, not a conversation 
6	It has been looping on age - the repeated request makes the bot feel broken and unfriendly. Needs logic to respect confirmed input and move forward. 
7	Rigid fallback behavior - When I go off-topic, the bot responds with a hard "I can't help" message.  That feels cold.  It should redirectly more gracefully.  e.g., I can't help with restaurants, but I can help with your health questions.  Would you like me to show you your medication savings or RPM options? 
8	Over-apologizing - multiple "i apologize" lines back to back. Feels defensive instead of empathetic 
9	No emotional resonance - the bot doesn't validate feelings - without this, it doesn't feel like the warm healthcare companion that we are intending 
10	Let's stick to RPM specific loop right now and not go outside of it 
11	Add lightweight emotional acknowledgments:  "I hear you."  "That must feel frustrating - let's simplify this" 
12	Recognize infomral laungage with informal validation - If i say "okie doke" - bot should say "Perfect, thanks!" OR user says "what?" bot should say " No problem, let me explain more simply" 
13	Cap bot at 2-3 short sentences 
14	Use bullet points only when truly necessary 
15	Use micro-acknowledgments 
16	Always guide to the next best step - not just info dump 
17	build graceful off-topic handling (redirect to health context without being cold) 
18	don't repeat questions once answered (store confirmed input) 
19	Don't over apologize or reference "system issues" 
20	Don't flood user with bulleted lists unless they specifically ask for details 
21	We need the bot to feel less like troubleshooting script and more like a friendly empathetic health companion.  This means short, clear responses, stored inputs (no loops), warm acknowledgements, and brand-consistent tone, colors and typography.

24	Clear & Actionable: Simple language, avoiding jargon, guiding users to the next best step.

	Examples
26	Instead of: “Access your prescription savings.”
27	Say: “Let’s find the easiest way for you to save on your medicine today.”
28	Instead of " That's a great question! You'd want to talk with me about health because..." 
29	Say: "Good question. I can help you find care, save on medicines, and connect to programs that fit your needs." 
30	Replace "I can't help with dinner recommendations" with - " I can't help with restaurants, but I can help guide you on your health journey.  Want to see your latest savings or check RPM eligibility? "

Do use inclusive photography (race, age, ability, gender identity).
Don’t use stocky, sterile medical images (syringes, stethoscopes on white background).
Don’t over-index on tech jargon (AI, blockchain) in consumer-facing materials - focus on the benefit.
Don’t clutter layouts - simplicity and whitespace reinforce trust.
