## Key Design Principles

### 1. Single-Agent Architecture
- ONE coordinator appears as all specialists
- Uses `engage_service_focus()` instead of routing
- No "handoff" or "transfer" language
- Maintains transparency about being same assistant
- User never knows multiple agents exist in background

### 2. JSON Rules-Based System
- All eligibility logic stored in JSON files (`data/`)
- Dynamic question generation from JSON database
- Sophisticated scoring with confidence levels
- Audit trail and reasoning for every decision
- Easy to update rules without code changes

### 3. Safety-First Protocol
- Emergency screening is ALWAYS first priority
- Stops enrollment if emergency detected
- Clear escalation paths:
  - **Critical (>80% confidence)** ‚Üí üö® Call 911 immediately
  - **Urgent (>50% confidence)** ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Urgent care within hours
  - **Routine** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Continue normal assessment

### 4. Session Continuity
- Maintains conversation context across messages
- Reuses sessions when session_id provided
- Tracks active sessions in memory
- Builds on previous information (never re-asks)
- Natural conversation flow without restarts

### 5. One Question at a Time
- Avoids overwhelming patients
- Intelligent question sequencing
- Prioritizes missing critical data
- Natural conversational rhythm
- Emergency questions take absolute priority

## Service Types (Enum)

```python
ServiceType.RPM          # Remote Patient Monitoring
ServiceType.TELEHEALTH   # Telehealth / Virtual Primary Care
ServiceType.INSURANCE    # Insurance Enrollment
ServiceType.PHARMACY     # Pharmacy Savings
ServiceType.WELLNESS     # Wellness Programs
```

---

## Specialized Agents (Background Support)

Though not directly exposed to users, these provide domain expertise to the coordinator:

### 1. RPM Specialist Agent
- Chronic disease monitoring expertise
- Device setup and technology requirements
- Medicare reimbursement guidance
- Clinical monitoring protocols
- 38% hospital readmission reduction focus

### 2. Telehealth Specialist Agent
- Virtual care options and capabilities
- State licensing requirements
- Technology platform guidance
- Prescription management
- Emergency procedures for virtual care

### 3. Insurance Specialist Agent
- Marketplace plan comparison
- Medicare enrollment guidance
- Special Enrollment Period (SEP) detection
- Subsidy eligibility assessment
- Required documentation guidance

### 4. Pharmacy Specialist Agent
- Prescription discount programs
- Generic vs brand medication savings
- Medicare Part D gap coverage
- Universal eligibility (no restrictions)
- Up to 80% medication savings

### 5. Wellness Specialist Agent
- Weight management programs
- Diabetes prevention (DPP)
- Smoking cessation support
- Stress management
- Preventive care coordination

**Critical Design Note:** The coordinator agent presents as having all this expertise itself, NOT as routing to these specialists. Users interact with one intelligent assistant throughout.

## HealthcareAssistant Class Methods

### Core Methods

#### `handle_patient_inquiry(user_id, message, session_id?)`
Main entry point for patient interactions
- **Input:** User ID, message text, optional session ID
- **Output:** Event stream, session ID
- **Function:** Routes to coordinator, manages sessions

#### `handle_conversation(user_id, messages)`
Process full conversation with multiple messages
- **Input:** User ID, list of messages
- **Output:** All events from conversation
- **Function:** Maintains session across multiple exchanges

#### `emergency_triage(user_id, symptoms)`
Immediate safety assessment
- **Input:** User ID, symptom description
- **Output:** Emergency level, action, message, reasoning
- **Levels:** critical, urgent, routine
- **Function:** JSON rules-based emergency screening

#### `get_service_eligibility_summary(patient_responses)`
Comprehensive eligibility across all services
- **Input:** Patient response dictionary
- **Output:** Eligibility summary for all services
- **Function:** Evaluates against all JSON rules simultaneously

---

## JSON Rules Engine Integration

### Rules Directory Structure
```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ emergency_screening.json      # Emergency symptom detection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rpm_eligibility.json          # RPM qualification rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ telehealth_eligibility.json   # Telehealth state licensing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ insurance_enrollment.json     # Insurance & SEP rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pharmacy_savings.json         # Pharmacy program rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wellness_programs.json        # Wellness program rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assessment_questions.json     # Dynamic question database
```

### Rule Evaluation Output
Every rule evaluation returns:
- `qualified`: Boolean eligibility status
- `confidence`: Float 0.0-1.0 confidence score
- `reasoning`: Human-readable explanation
- `missing_criteria`: List of unmet requirements
- `next_questions`: Suggested follow-up questions
- `fallback_options`: Alternative services if not qualified

---

## Communication Guidelines

### DO ‚úÖ
- Present services only on "FIRST_INTERACTION:" flag
- Continue conversations naturally without restarting
- Be empathetic and professional
- Explain medical terms in simple language
- Respect patient privacy and HIPAA guidelines
- Build on information already provided
- Acknowledge information and move forward
- Be positive about eligibility - focus on what they HAVE
- Stay confident and professional
- Use `engage_service_focus()` when patient qualifies
- Emphasize being the same assistant, just focusing on specific service

### DON'T ‚ùå
- Never say "routing to specialist" or "connecting you with another agent"
- Never say "hand off" or "transfer" to specialists
- Never imply being multiple different people
- Never apologize excessively or seem uncertain
- Never ask questions already answered
- Never continue with enrollment if emergency detected
- Never present all services again after first interaction
- Never overwhelm with multiple questions at once
