**Test:** `python test_phase2_features.py`
**Expected Result:**
```
RPM Assessment:
🏥 Remote Patient Monitoring Assessment:
Status: ❌ NOT QUALIFIED (Confidence: 12%)
Reasoning: ✅ Meets criteria: Recent hospital discharge with high readmission risk

Telehealth Assessment:
🏥 Telehealth Assessment:
Status: ❌ NOT QUALIFIED (Confidence: 9%)
Reasoning: ✅ Meets criteria: Insurance covers telehealth OR user accepts cash pay
```

#### **3. Missing Data Identification**
**Test:** `python test_phase2_features.py`
**Expected Result:**
```
Missing critical data:
['chronic health conditions', 'recent hospitalization history', 'technology comfort level', 'state of residence', 'household income']
```

#### **4. Question Priority Filtering**
**Test:** `python test_phase2_features.py`
**Expected Result:**
```
Scenario: Missing age and chronic conditions
Missing data: ['age', 'chronic health conditions', 'recent hospitalization history', 'technology comfort level', 'state of residence', 'household income']
Next questions: ['What is your year of birth?', 'Would you like to connect Apple Health/Google Fit?']
```

## 🚀 **Quick Test Commands**

### **Test Everything (Recommended):**
```bash
# 1. Quick overview
python optimized_demo.py

# 2. Full feature test
python test_phase2_features.py

# 3. Interactive testing
python test_interactive_app.py
```

### **Test Individual Components:**
```bash
# Test CSV rules engine only
python -c "
from app.rules_engine import DynamicRulesEngine
from config import CSV_PATHS
engine = DynamicRulesEngine(CSV_PATHS)
print('✅ CSV rules loaded successfully')
"

# Test question generation only
python -c "
from app.rules_engine import get_next_assessment_questions
import json
questions = get_next_assessment_questions(json.dumps({}))
print('✅ Questions generated:', questions)
"

# Test service assessment only
python -c "
from app.rules_engine import assess_service_specific_eligibility
import json
result = assess_service_specific_eligibility('rpm', json.dumps({'age': 65, 'chronic_conditions': 'diabetes'}))
print('✅ Assessment completed:', result[:100])
"
```

## 🎯 **Expected Test Results**

7. ✅ **Conversation Flow** - Natural user interaction

### **Performance Metrics:**
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds per interaction
- **Question Generation**: < 100ms
- **Eligibility Assessment**: < 200ms
- **Service Routing**: < 100ms

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**
1. **API Rate Limits**: Use `optimized_demo.py` or `demo_app_rate_limited.py`
2. **Import Errors**: Run from project root directory
3. **CSV Errors**: Check data files exist in `data/` directory
4. **No Response**: Check API key configuration

### **Debug Mode:**
Add debug prints to see what's happening:
```python
# In app/smart_health_agent.py
print(f"DEBUG: Processing message: {message}")
print(f"DEBUG: Missing data: {missing_data}")
```
