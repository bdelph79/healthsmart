# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Basic Healthcare Assistant App Implementation Plan

### Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the step-by-step implementation plan to transform the current `smart_health_agent.py` into a fully functional basic healthcare assistant app that presents services (RPM, Telehealth, Insurance) and routes users based on their needs using the coordinator-specialist agent architecture.

### Current State Analysis

#### ‚úÖ **Existing Features in `smart_health_agent.py`**
- Basic agent definitions (Coordinator + 3 Specialists)
- Hardcoded eligibility scoring logic
- Session management with InMemorySessionService
- Basic tool functions (load_routing_rules, assess_patient_eligibility, etc.)
- PatientContext and RoutingRule data structures
- Async conversation handling

#### ‚ùå **Critical Gaps Identified**

| Feature | Current State | Required State | Priority |
|---------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Service Presentation** | ‚ùå Missing | ‚úÖ Present 3 services clearly | HIGH |
| **CSV Rules Integration** | ‚ùå Hardcoded | ‚úÖ Dynamic CSV-based rules | HIGH |
| **Agent Handoff** | ‚ùå No handoff logic | ‚úÖ Route to specialists | HIGH |
| **Question Flow** | ‚ùå Static questions | ‚úÖ Dynamic assessment | MEDIUM |
| **Service Details** | ‚ùå Basic info only | ‚úÖ Rich service information | MEDIUM |
| **Multi-Service Support** | ‚ùå Single service focus | ‚úÖ Handle multiple services | LOW |

### Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Integration (Week 1)

### Step 1.1: Integrate CSV Rules Engine
**Objective**: Replace hardcoded rules with dynamic CSV-based system

**Tasks**:
```python
# 1. Import rules engine
from app.rules_engine import DynamicRulesEngine, load_dynamic_rules, assess_eligibility_dynamically

# 2. Replace HealthcareRulesEngine with DynamicRulesEngine
class HealthcareAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules_engine = DynamicRulesEngine(CSV_PATHS)  # Use CSV-based engine
        # ... rest of initialization
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Update imports in `smart_health_agent.py`
- [ ] Replace hardcoded rules with CSV integration
- [ ] Test rules engine loading and processing

### Step 1.2: Add Service Presentation

**Tasks**:
```python
# Add service presentation tool
def present_available_services() -> str:
    """Present the 3 main services to users"""
    return """

### Step 1.3: Implement Basic Agent Handoff
**Objective**: Route users to appropriate specialist agents

**Tasks**:
```python
# Add handoff logic to HealthcareAssistant
async def route_to_specialist(self, service_type: ServiceType, context: PatientContext):
    """Route user to appropriate specialist agent"""
    specialist = self.specialists.get(service_type)
    if specialist:
        # Create handoff context
        handoff_context = {
            "patient_context": context,
            "service_type": service_type,
            "conversation_stage": "specialist_consultation"
        }
        # Transfer to specialist
        return await self.handle_specialist_consultation(specialist, handoff_context)
```

**Deliverables**:

```python
# Enhance question generation
def get_next_assessment_questions(self, context: PatientContext) -> List[str]:
    """Generate next questions based on current context and missing data"""
    # Use CSV-based question generation
    questions = self.rules_engine.generate_assessment_questions()
    
    # Filter based on missing information
    missing_data = self.identify_missing_critical_data(context)
    relevant_questions = self.filter_questions_by_priority(questions, missing_data)
    
    return relevant_questions[:2]  # Limit to 2 questions
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Implement dynamic question generation
- [ ] Add missing data identification logic
- [ ] Test question flow with different user scenarios

### Step 2.2: Service-Specific Assessment
**Objective**: Tailor questions based on user's service interest

**Tasks**:
```python
# Add service-specific assessment
def assess_service_specific_eligibility(self, service_type: ServiceType, context: PatientContext) -> EligibilityResult:
    """Assess eligibility for specific service using CSV rules"""
    return self.rules_engine.evaluate_patient_against_rules(
        context.responses, 
        service_type.value
    )
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Add service-specific eligibility assessment
- [ ] Integrate with CSV rules engine
- [ ] Test eligibility scoring accuracy

## Phase 3: User Experience (Week 3)

### Step 3.1: Rich Service Information
**Objective**: Provide detailed service information to users

    service_info = {
        ServiceType.RPM: {
            "description": "Monitor chronic conditions with connected devices",
            "benefits": ["24/7 monitoring", "Reduces readmissions by 38%", "Insurance covered"],

    """Coordinate when user qualifies for multiple services"""
    qualified_services = [s for s, result in eligibility_results.items() if result.qualified]
    
    if len(qualified_services) > 1:
        return self.create_service_priority_plan(qualified_services)
