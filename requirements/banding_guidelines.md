Style: authentic, optimistic, community-oriented.
Illustrations: minimal line + soft fills for digital assets.
Icons: rounded corners, flat design (Lucide/Feather style).


Voice & Tone
Warm & Empathetic: Speak like a trusted health guide, not a cold insurer or tech company.
Inclusive & Empowering: Gender-neutral, culturally sensitive, respectful.
Clear & Actionable: Simple language, avoiding jargon, guiding users to the next best step.
Forward-Looking: Confident about tech, AI, and innovation — but always framed as “human-first.”

Examples
Instead of: “Access your prescription savings.”
Say: “Let’s find the easiest way for you to save on your medicine today.”

Applications
Website: Soft gradients of teal and sky blue, with coral call-to-action buttons. Generous whitespace.
Decks: Use Raleway for headlines, PT Serif for body, coral/gold highlights for key stats.
One-Pagers / Handouts: White background, hero imagery of people, teal accent borders.
Social Media: Use bold color pops (teal + coral), overlay inspirational short phrases in Raleway bold.
Product UI: Minimalist, teal/blue dominant, with warm accent highlights for calls to action.

Do’s and Don’ts
Do keep tone personal, conversational, and positive.
Do highlight “community impact” and “health journeys.”
Do use inclusive photography (race, age, ability, gender identity).
Don’t use stocky, sterile medical images (syringes, stethoscopes on white background).
Don’t over-index on tech jargon (AI, blockchain) in consumer-facing materials - focus on the benefit.
Don’t clutter layouts - simplicity and whitespace reinforce trust.
