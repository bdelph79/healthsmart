## 🤖 LLM Role Breakdown

### 1. **Natural Language Understanding**
- **Input:** User messages in natural language
- **Processing:** Intent recognition, entity extraction
- **Output:** Structured data for tool calls
- **Example:** "I need help with my diabetes" → Service: "rpm", Intent: "help"

### 2. **Conversation Management**
- **Input:** Conversation context and history
- **Processing:** Context awareness, memory management
- **Output:** Contextual responses and follow-ups
- **Example:** Remembers previous answers when asking follow-up questions

### 3. **Tool Orchestration**
- **Input:** User requests and conversation state
- **Processing:** Determines which tool to call and when
- **Output:** Tool calls with appropriate parameters
- **Example:** Calls `ask_service_questions()` after `get_service_details()`

### 4. **Response Formatting**
- **Input:** Tool outputs and raw data
- **Processing:** Natural language generation
- **Output:** Human-readable responses
- **Example:** CSV data → "Here are our available services: 1) RPM..."

### 5. **Decision Making**
- **Input:** Patient responses and eligibility criteria
- **Processing:** Reasoning and confidence assessment
- **Output:** Eligibility decisions and recommendations
- **Example:** "You qualify for RPM with 85% confidence because..."
